# VeTeSS-Topcase-Verification-Plugin


###  Demonstrator for the Topcased VeTeSS plugin.

This readme file gives the instructions necessary for reproducing the experiments made
with the Topcased VeTeSS plugin. Additional information can be found in the VeTeSS
deliverables.

The demonstrator requires a Windows PC with the following software installed:
- TOPCASED 5.3.0 (http://www.topcased.org)
- PAT 3.4.3 (http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~pat/)
- CYGWIN (http://www.cygwin.com/)
- CADP/TGV 2014-j ìAmsterdamî (http://www.inrialpes.fr/vasy/cadp/)

Note that Cygwin is required by CADP/TGV, hence it must be installed before CADP/TGV, by following the instructions in the CADP/TGV web site. It must be installed in the root of the C: disk drive.
For CADP/TGV, the default installation location must be selected.
